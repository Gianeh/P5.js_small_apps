# P5.js_small_apps
I just wanted to upload some of the super small apps I wrote in P5.js, mainly using the online editor.

**How to run:**
You can easily copy the code to the mentioned editor https://editor.p5js.org/ to have a preview, or you can use "Web Server for Chrome" or other alternatives to open a small web server of the folder that contains the app/apps and navigate to 127.0.0.1:your_port to load the index file (which contains the links to pj5 lib).

Part of the inspiration for my small work comes from "**The coding train**", I strongly encourage to follow him if you don't already. https://thecodingtrain.com/
