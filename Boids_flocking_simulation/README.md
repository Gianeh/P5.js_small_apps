**the most basic Flocking simulation**:
Boids behaviour is changed trough the three sliders.

First: **Alignment**

Second: **Cohesion**

Third: **Separation**


In the future I will update this app with advanced rules. at current time probably there are also some bugs and issues with the boids control.
